API Usage
=========

This section describes usage of the rocFFT library API.

Types
-----

There are a few data structures that are internal to the library. The pointer types to these
structures are given below. The user would need to use these types to create handles and pass them
between different library functions.

.. doxygentypedef:: rocfft_plan

.. doxygentypedef:: rocfft_plan_description

.. doxygentypedef:: rocfft_execution_info

Library Setup and Cleanup
-------------------------

The following functions deal with initialization and cleanup of the library.

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_setup

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_cleanup

Plan
----

The following functions are used to create and destroy plan objects.

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_create

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_destroy

The following functions are used to query for information after a plan is created.

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_get_work_buffer_size

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_get_print

Plan description
----------------

Most of the time, :cpp:func:`rocfft_plan_create` is able to fully
specify a transform.  Advanced plan details such as strides and
offsets require creation of a plan description object, which is
configured and passed to the :cpp:func:`rocfft_plan_create` function.

The plan description object can be safely destroyed after it is given
to the :cpp:func:`rocfft_plan_create` function.

.. comment doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_description_set_scale_double

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_description_set_data_layout

.. comment doxygenfunction:: rocfft_plan_description_set_devices

Execution
---------

After a plan has been created, it can be executed using the
:cpp:func:`rocfft_execute` function,
to compute a transform on specified data. Aspects of the execution can be controlled and any useful
information returned to the user.

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execute

Execution info
--------------

:cpp:func:`rocfft_execute` takes an optional :cpp:type:`rocfft_execution_info` parameter. This parameter encapsulates
information such as the work buffer and compute stream for the transform.

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execution_info_create

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execution_info_destroy

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execution_info_set_work_buffer

.. doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execution_info_set_stream

.. comment doxygenfunction:: rocfft_execution_info_get_events
